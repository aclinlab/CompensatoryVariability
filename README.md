# CompensatoryVariability
This code can be used to recreate the results and the main figures in Abdelrahman, Vasilaki and Lin 2021: 
Compensatory variability in network parameters enhances memory performance in the Drosophila mushroom body.

The code is organised in the following subfolders:

  1. For Fig 2,3,4 and S1, go to the folder "Variability_degrades_Perf"
  1. For Fig 5, S2, S3 and S4, go to the folder "Compens_variab_rescue_Perf"
  1. For Fig 6 and S3E, go to "Robustness_analysis"
  1. For Fig 7 and S5, go to "connectome".
